# *_BLACK STAR_*
## _*A text based game, inspired by a story i am writing*_
### You are but a knight of the kingdom of stars, a young early 20s peasent who became a knight, promising to protect the kingdom with all your might. Your goals are simple, become the head of the military and even possibly marry the beautiful Lyra, the princess of stars. 
### your joureny begins after you finish a long and tedious escort mission to a manor, from there you can begin your journey. You can take a carriage, either with a group of beautiful women or a dad and his daughter. 
### You can go with your trusty steed, riding then through either the mountain range or by the lake.
### You can go walking, a long jounrey with your feet where you will stop at multiple villages, you have then the option of staying or leaving them, careful, because your stamina is important, and who knows, maybe being late would do good for you.
### the final option is to go with a boat via the lake, you will have the option of what to take, weather to make your boat heavy with items or not, and which way you can go via the lake, and who knows, maybe you will end up finding something valuable and important on your way.
### going futher, i will not. As it will spoil the game if i say so myself, it will take you out of the feeling of the unknown world.
